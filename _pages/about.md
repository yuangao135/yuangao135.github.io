I am a first year PhD student at UBC Okanagan campus, supervised by Prof. Heinz Bauschke. I finished my MSc in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London (IC) and BSc in Applied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU). 

My research interests are convex analysis, monotone operator theory and fixed point theory.
